## Add\-In \- Task List for VB IDE


</div>

### Description

I created this VB add-in to help me out when coding projects. I wanted

something to allow me to add a todo list right inside the VB IDE. This

addin shows a listview of tasks with checkboxes for each. The window

will dock to the IDE, and you can add new tasks by right clicking on the

listview and choosing "new task" or by doubleclicking in an empty slot.

You can edit tasks directly in the listview via the 2 click method.

Completed items are shown in gray(disabled) text. A different task list

is kept for each project. note: multiple projects open in the same

instance of VB is not supported...yet...There is alot of good stuff here,

I hope you like it.
